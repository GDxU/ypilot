# component definitions
# format:
#
# a ComponentAdjective thing is OtherAdj1 and OtherAdj2 and has
#   a propertyName which is a PropertyType
#   ...
#
# where PropertyType can be:
#   OtherAdj thing
#   JSConstructor object
#   jstype (string, number, etc.)
#   Array of PropertyType
#
# Since "has an isFoo which is a boolean" sounds awkward, the alternate syntax
# "has an isFoo flag" is available for this case.
# Similarly "has a foos which is an Array of bar" can be rephrased as "has some
# foos which are bars".
# The whole "which is a PropertyType" part can be omitted, meaning anything can
# be a value of this property.

# different agents than those who hear

# Entity type definitions
# format:
# a EntityTypeName is a SuperTypeName1 and a SuperTypeName2 ... and Adj1 and Adj2 ...
# FIXME I'm not sure I really need the adjective part of these, since the adjectives should all be specified at creation time with their property values
