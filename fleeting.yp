# expires after some time has elapsed (distinct from hitpoints)
a Fleeting thing has
  a timeToLive which is a number (default 30) # 30 ticks, i.e. 1 second

in the event ?f Expires then ?f is a Fleeting thing

when ?f Expires then ?f is removed

when the clock ticks and
  there is a thing ?f which is Fleeting with timeToLive ?t
  (?t > 0)
then
  ?f becomes Fleeting with timeToLive (?t - 1)

when ?f becomes Fleeting with timeToLive 0
then ?f Expires
