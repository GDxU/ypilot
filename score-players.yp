use "standard:scoreboard.yp"

when ?player is added and ?player is a Player
then ?player becomes Scored with score 0 # FIXME default not working

when ?board is added and
  ?board is BoardLike with rowTypes ?oldTypes
then ?board becomes BoardLike with rowTypes (?oldTypes + the Typing thing "Player")
