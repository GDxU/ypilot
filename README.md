# YPilot #

YPilot is a multiplayer 2D space game. It can be played in a web browser that supports modern JavaScript, SVG, and WebRTC. It is tested on Firefox and Chrome, and may also work on Safari and Edge. [Play YPilot](https://willdb.net/ypilot/ypilot.html).

YPilot is a spiritual successor to [XPilot](http://www.xpilot.org/), which in turn borrows from classic games such as Gravitar, Thrust, Asteroids, and ultimately [Spacewar!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacewar!), the first known video game to be played at multiple computer installations.

YPilot is designed to be flexible and extensible, with a small core of functionality written in JavaScript, and most of the game rules written in a simple, English-like language, documented in [README-yp.md](README-yp.md). Players can choose from a number of included game modes/maps, or create their own.
