# mobile penetrator and penetrated
# TODO

# FIXME the above doesn't handle multiple collisions in the same frame well
# in particular, it's possible for a single frame to cause two penetrate events leading to two parallel(ish) becomeLocated events, which is a problem when both becomeLocated events moves the thing to a new bin, because the second becomeLocated event has already saved the old location, so it will try to remove the thing from the old bin again
# more commonly, if the ship is penetrated by a point shared by two walls, double (or more?) velocity is added
