when ?player is added and
  ?player is a Player
  there is a thing ?map which is
    Located with space ?space
  ?map is a Map
then
  ?player MakesTheirShip in ?space at Vec2[64,64]

# start with infinite lives
when ?ship is added and
  ?ship is a Ship
  ?ship is Located with space ?space and position ?position
then
  a new Point ?spawnPoint is added which is
    Located with space ?space and position ?position
  ?ship becomes Respawnable with
    spawnPoint ?spawnPoint and
    spawnDelay 30 and
    lives âˆž and
