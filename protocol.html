<h1>YPilot Network Protocol</h1>
<p>This document describes the protocol YPilot uses to connect players over the internet. In this document, computer code is displayed <code>like this</code> and variables are displayed <var>like this</var>.</p>

<h2>Player profiles</h2>
<p>Each player has a permanent <dfn>player ID</dfn> (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122">UUID</a><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122#section-4.1.3">v4</a>), a permanent <dfn>public key</dfn> and <dfn>private key</dfn> (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3447#section-8.1">RSASSA-PSS</a> 2048 / <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/publications/fips/180/4/final/documents/fips180-4-draft-aug2014.pdf">SHA</a>-256; see the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI/">Web Crypto API</a>), and a <dfn>handle</dfn> they can change. The handle is displayed to identify the player during gameplay, but the ID and key pair are used to identify and authenticate the player while setting up a network connection. In this document we will use <var>Alice</var>, <var>Bob</var>, <var>Charlie</var>, and <var>Eve</var> as example players.</p>

<p>In order for <var>Alice</var> to initiate a connection to <var>Bob</var>, <var>Alice</var> must know <var>Bob</var>'s ID. Normally <var>Bob</var> would send <var>Alice</var> a link to join <var>Bob</var>'s current game, and this link would include <var>Bob</var>'s ID.</p>

<p>Player's profiles also include IDs, public keys, and known handles of every other player they've played with. Keys follow a Trust On First Use (TOFU) policy: the first time <var>Alice</var> connects to <var>Bob</var>, <var>Alice</var> stores the public key <var>Bob</var> sends her. For later connections, <var>Alice</var> checks that <var>Bob</var>'s initial message is signed with <var>Bob</var>'s private key by verifying the message against the stored public key.</p>

<h2>Signaling relay</h2>
<p>In general, players do not know each other's network addresses at first, so a third party is necessary to initiate a connection. This third party is the <dfn>signaling relay</dfn>. The signaling relay allows two players who share a <dfn>relay ID</dfn> to send messages in one direction; the receiver first makes a request to the relay with just the relay ID, which stalls until the sender makes another request to the relay with the relay ID and a message. Then the receiver receives the message, and both requests terminate. To send multiple messages both sides must make multiple requests.</p>

<p>YPilot shares its signaling relay with <a href="https://github.com/wdebeaum/svg-whiteboard">SVG Whiteboard</a>. The default <dfn>relay <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1738">URL</a></dfn> is <code>https://willdb.net/cgi-bin/relay.pl</code>, but other <a href="https://github.com/wdebeaum/svg-whiteboard/blob/master/relay.pl">relays</a> may be used instead as long as all players who wish to connect to each other agree.</p>

<p>The relay ID must consist of alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores, and must be at least one character. If the message contains any line feed (<code>\n</code>) or carriage return (<code>\r</code>) characters, they will be converted to spaces.</p>

<p>To receive a message from relay ID <var>foo</var>, <var>Alice</var> makes an HTTPS <code>POST</code> request to the relay URL with the parameter <code>k=<var>foo</var></code>. To send a message <var>bar</var> to <var>Alice</var>, <var>Bob</var> can then make an HTTPS <code>POST</code> request to the relay URL with the parameters <code>k=<var>foo</var>&amp;m=<var>bar</var></code>. The parameters must appear in that order, and <var>bar</var> must be URL-encoded. The relay will respond to <var>Alice</var>'s request with (decoded) <var>bar</var> as the content, and it will respond to <var>Bob</var>'s request with empty content.</p>

<p>A bidirectional signaling relay may be set up with two relay IDs, a <dfn>send ID</dfn> and a <dfn>receive ID</dfn>. Two players share both IDs, and <var>Alice's</var> send ID is <var>Bob</var>'s receive ID, and vice versa. The two relay IDs should be created randomly when the bidirectional signaling relay is set up (i.e. they are UUIDv4s, like player IDs, but specific to the connection).</p>

<h2>WebRTC</h2>
<p>Once a bidirectional signaling relay exists, it can be used to set up a <dfn>peer connection</dfn> using <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webrtc/">WebRTC</a>. This type of connection is potentially more direct, and will take the load off of the signaling relay. To set up a peer connection, players negotiate over the signaling relay (involving <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5245">ICE</a> candidates and offers) until a way to connect is agreed upon.</p>

<h2>Hub</h2>
<p>At any point during a game, exactly one player is designated the <dfn>hub</dfn>. All non-hub players maintain peer connections with the hub. All players (including the hub) simulate the game world in parallel. All input events must travel through the hub to be sequenced and rebroadcast before any players (including the hub) may incorporate them into the simulation.</p>

<p>Which player is the hub may change during the game, and must change if the hub leaves a game that still has other players. <em class="TODO">how to do this deterministically and fairly, even when the hub is forcibly disconnected?</em></p>

<h2>Messages</h2>
<p>All messages exchanged by YPilot players are <a href="https://json.org/">JSON</a> objects. Most have a common property named <code>op</code> (short for "operation") which is a string identifying the type of message.</p>

<h3>Player descriptions</h3>
<p>A common part of many messages is a <dfn>player description</dfn>:</p>
<code><pre>
{
  "id": "<var>player-id</var>",
  "handle": "<var>handle</var>",
  "publicKey": <var>public-key-JWK</var>,
  "thing": <var>player-thing-number</var>
}
</pre></code>
<p>The player's public key is given in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517">JSON Web Key (JWK)</a> format. The <code>thing</code> property is only present when the player has been added to a game, and identifies the player as a thing within that game.</p>

<h3>Initial messages</h3>
<p>An <dfn>initial message</dfn> is a message sent over a signaling relay before a player is connected to another player. Initial messages have a <code>sender</code> property containing a description of the player who sent the message.</p>

<p>Initial messages are turned into <dfn>signed messages</dfn> before being sent over the signaling relay. First the message is encoded as a <a href="https://unicode.org/">UTF-8</a> string, then a <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648#section-4">base64</a> encoded signature is generated using the sender's private key. Then the message string and the signature string are put in a new JSON object, and that object is sent over the signaling relay.</p>

<p>So an initial message that starts out looking like this:</p>
<code><pre>
{
  "<var>key1</var>": <var>val1</var>,
  "<var>key2</var>": <var>val2</var>
}
</pre></code>

<p>first has a <code>sender</code> added like this:</p>
<code><pre>
{
  "sender": <var>sender-desc</var>,
  "<var>key1</var>": <var>val1</var>,
  "<var>key2</var>": <var>val2</var>
}
</pre></code>

<p>and ends up being sent as a signed message that looks like this:</p>
<code><pre>
{
  msg: "{\"sender\":<var>sender</var>,\"<var>key1</var>\":<var>val1</var>,\"<var>key2</var>\":<var>val2</var>}",
  sig: "<var>msg-signature-base64</var>"
}
</pre></code>

<p>The receiver of such a signed message then unwraps it again, verifying the signature and trusting the public key on first use (TOFU). If the signature is invalid or the public key doesn't match one the receiver already has associated with the <code>id</code> of this <var>sender</var>, the message is dropped.</p>

<p>Other details of initial messages depend on the value of the <code>op</code> property:</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>"askStatus"</code>
<dd>If <var>Alice</var> wants to know what game <var>Bob</var> is playing and with whom, she sends an <code>askStatus</code> initial message to <var>Bob</var>'s player ID via the signaling relay:
<code><pre>
{
  "op": "askStatus",
  "replyTo": "<var>recvID</var>"
}
</pre></code>
If <var>Bob</var> wishes to, he can then send a <code>status</code> initial message (described below) to <var>recvID</var> via the signaling relay. <var>Alice</var> should start listening for this reply before sending the <code>askStatus</code> message.
<dt><code>"status"</code>
<dd>If <var>Bob</var> wishes to reply to an <code>askStatus</code> message, he can send a <code>status</code> initial message to <var>recvID</var> via the signaling relay:
<code><pre>
{
  "op": "status",
  "configURL": "<var>config-URL</var>"
  "players": [<var>player-desc-1</var>, <var>player-desc-2</var>, ...]
}
</pre></code>
The <var>config-URL</var> is the URL to load the <code><a href="README-yp.html">.yp</a></code> file describing the game from. <var>Bob</var> should be included in the <code>"players"</code> list, as the first player (<var>player-desc-1</var>).
<dt><code>"join"</code>
<dd>If <var>Alice</var> wants to join the game that <var>Bob</var> is playing (whether or not <var>Bob</var> is the hub), she can send a <code>join</code> initial message to <var>Bob</var>'s player ID via the signaling relay:
<code><pre>
{
  "op": "join",
  "replyTo": "<var>recvID</var>"
}
</pre></code>
If <var>Bob</var> wishes to let <var>Alice</var> join the game, and <var>Bob</var> is the hub, he can start setting up a peer connection with <var>Alice</var> by sending a <code>handshake</code> initial message to <var>recvID</var>. If <var>Bob</var> isn't the hub, he can instead send a <code>vouch</code> peer message to the hub.
<dt><code>"handshake"</code>
<dd>The <code>handshake</code> message moves the signaling relay into a mode where it can be used to facilitate setting up a peer connection with WebRTC. Continuing the above example, <var>Bob</var> already has a <var>recvID</var> for sending messages back to <var>Alice</var> via the signaling relay. By sending a <code>handshake</code> to <var>recvID</var>, he also creates a <var>sendID</var> for <var>Alice</var> to send messages back to <var>Bob</var>:
<code><pre>
{
  "op": "handshake",
  "replyTo": "<var>sendID</var>",
  "configURL": "<var>config-URL</var>"
}
</pre></code>
Now the signaling relay is bidirectional, and specific to the new connection between <var>Alice</var> and <var>Bob</var>. From this point on it will be used for WebRTC setup messages instead of initial messages. The joining player, <var>Alice</var>, does two things: First, she loads the <code>.yp</code> file from <var>config-URL</var> (which may turn out to be different from that of a previous <code>status</code> message). Then she uses her end of the peer connection to create a data channel.
</dl>
<em class="TODO">direct text messages?</em>

<h3>WebRTC setup messages</h3>
<p>A <dfn>setup message</dfn> is a message sent over a bidirectional signaling relay connecting the hub player of a game to a new player trying to join the game. These messages are used by the WebRTC protocol to set up a peer connection between the two players, so that they can stop using the relay and communicate more directly (using a data channel associated with the peer connection).</p>

<p>Unlike initial messages, setup messages are not signed and do not include a <code>sender</code>. The connection is already private because it's over HTTPS and uses relay IDs (<var>sendID</var> and <var>recvID</var>) known only to the two connected players (and the relay itself), and the players are already authenticated to each other because they signed the <code>join</code> and <code>handshake</code> initial messages that set up the bidirectional signaling relay.</p>

<em class="TODO">perhaps these messages should still be signed. it would prevent a MITM attack by the relay server if the attacker didn't control the server when trust was first established (public keys exchanged) between the two connecting players.</em>

<p>The <code>op</code> property identifies the type of message:</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>"offer"</code> / <code>"answer"</code>
<dd>These messages are used to exchange session descriptions (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3264">SDP offer/answer</a>).
<code><pre>
{
  "op": "<var>op</var>",
  "description": <var>session-desc</var>
}
</pre></code>
When either message type is received, the receiver should set their remote description to <var>session-desc</var>. If it was an <code>offer</code>, the receiver should then create an answer, set their local description, and send that local description in an <code>answer</code> message.
<dt><code>"addCandidate"</code>
<dd>The <code>addCandidate</code> message requests the receiver to add an ICE candidate. A player sends it when their peer connection emits an <code>icecandidate</code> event with a non-<code>null</code> <code>candidate</code>.
<code><pre>
{
  "op": "addCandidate",
  "candidate": <var>ice-candidate</var>
}
</pre></code>
</dl>

<h3>Peer messages</h3>
<p>A <dfn>peer message</dfn> is one sent over a peer connection between the hub and another player. Again, these are not signed and don't have an explicit <code>sender</code>. The <code>op</code> property identifies the type of message:</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>"vouch"</code>
<dd>If <var>Alice</var> sent <var>Bob</var> a <code>join</code> initial message, and <var>Bob</var> wants to let <var>Alice</var> join, but <var>Bob</var> is not the hub, <var>Charlie</var> is, then <var>Bob</var> should send <var>Charlie</var> a <code>vouch</code> peer message:</p>
<code><pre>
{
  "op": "vouch",
  "vouchee": <var>Alice-desc</var>,
  "replyTo": "<var>Alice's-receive-ID</var>"
}
</pre></code>
<p>Then <var>Charlie</var> decides whether <var>Alice</var> can join; if so, <var>Charlie</var> sends <var>Alice</var> a <code>handshake</code> initial message using <var>Alice's-receive-ID</var>, and they continue to set up a new peer connection.</p>
<dt><code>"setState"</code>
<dd>The first message the hub should send to a new player is <code>setState</code>, giving the new player the complete, up-to-date state of the game (beyond what is in the <code>.yp</code> file).
<code><pre>
{
  "op": "setState",
  "players": [<var>player-desc-1</var>, <var>player-desc-2</var>, ...],
  "nextThing": <var>next-thing</var>,
  "adjectives": {
    "<var>Adj-1</var>": {
      "<var>thing-1</var>": <var>a1-t1-props</var>,
      ...
    },
    "<var>Adj-2</var>": { ... }
    ...
  }
  "playerKeysDown": {
    "<var>player-thing-1</var>": {
      "<var>key-code</var>": <var>key-is-down</var>,
      ...
    },
    ...
  }
}
</pre></code>
This includes the current list of players (which may have changed since a previous <code>"status"</code> initial message, but does not yet include the joining player), the thing numbers of the <var>next-thing</var> and all the things like <var>thing-1</var> currently described by adjectives like <var>Adj-1</var> and <var>Adj-2</var>, and their corresponding properties. It also includes the current state of each player's keyboard. Note that in this message, players are mostly identified by their thing numbers, not their IDs.
<dt><code>"addPlayer"</code>
<dd>After sending <code>setState</code> to a new player, the hub should broadcast an <code>addPlayer</code> message to all players (including the new player).
<code><pre>
{
  "op": "addPlayer",
  "player": <var>player-desc</var>
}
</pre></code>
<dt><code>"removePlayer"</code>
<dd>When a player disconnects from the hub, the hub should broadcast a <code>removePlayer</code> message to the remaining players.
<code><pre>
{
  "op": "removePlayer",
  "player": <var>player-desc</var>
}
</pre></code>
<dt><code>"press"</code> / <code>"release"</code>
<dd>When a player presses or releases a key on their keyboard, they send this message to the hub, who broadcasts it to all the players (including the original sender). The message takes effect only after the players receive it from the hub (at the next <code>clockTick</code>), even for the original sender.
<code><pre>
{
  "op": "<var>op</var>",
  "player": <var>player-thing-number</var>,
  "code": "<var>key-code</var>"
}
</pre></code>
Note that the player is identified here by their thing number, not their player ID or a full description.
<dt><code>"clockTick"</code>
<dd>When the hub starts simulating a frame (including processing all the input events since the previous frame), it broadcasts a <code>clockTick</code> message:
<code><pre>
{
  "op": "clockTick",
  "numTicks": <var>num-ticks</var>
}
</pre></code>
where <var>num-ticks</var> is the number of ticks that have happened since the beginning of the game, excluding this one. When a non-hub player receives a <code>clockTick</code> message, it processes all the input event messages it has received from the hub since the last <code>clockTick</code> message, and then runs one tick of the simulation (by emitting a <code>clockTick</code> event from the <code>Router</code>). The hub also does this after it sends the <code>clockTick</code> message.
</dl>
<em class="TODO">new messages/extensions to existing messages for managing hub switches/succession order (maybe remaining player with lowest thing ID gets to be the hub?)</em>
