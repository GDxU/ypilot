<h1>YPilot Network Protocol</h1>
<p>This document describes the protocol YPilot uses to connect players over the internet. In this document, computer code is displayed <code>like this</code> and variables are displayed <var>like this</var>.</p>

<h2>Player profiles</h2>
<p>Each player has a permanent <dfn>player ID</dfn> (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122">UUID</a><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122#section-4.1.3">v4</a>), a permanent <dfn>public key</dfn> and <dfn>private key</dfn> (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3447#section-8.1">RSASSA-PSS</a> 2048 / <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/publications/fips/180/4/final/documents/fips180-4-draft-aug2014.pdf">SHA</a>-256; see the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI/">Web Crypto API</a>), and a <dfn>handle</dfn> they can change. The handle is displayed to identify the player during gameplay, but the ID and key pair are used to identify and authenticate the player while setting up a network connection. In this document we will use <var>Alice</var>, <var>Bob</var>, <var>Charlie</var>, and <var>Eve</var> as example players.</p>

<p>In order for <var>Alice</var> to initiate a connection to <var>Bob</var>, <var>Alice</var> must know <var>Bob</var>'s ID. Normally <var>Bob</var> would send <var>Alice</var> a link to join <var>Bob</var>'s current game, and this link would include <var>Bob</var>'s ID.</p>

<p>Player's profiles also include IDs, public keys, and known handles of every other player they've played with. Keys follow a Trust On First Use (TOFU) policy: the first time <var>Alice</var> connects to <var>Bob</var>, <var>Alice</var> stores the public key <var>Bob</var> sends her. For later connections, <var>Alice</var> checks that <var>Bob</var>'s initial message is signed with <var>Bob</var>'s private key by verifying the message against the stored public key.</p>

<h2>Signaling relay</h2>
<p>In general, players do not know each other's network addresses at first, so a third party is necessary to initiate a connection. This third party is the <dfn>signaling relay</dfn>. The signaling relay allows two players who share a <dfn>relay ID</dfn> to send messages in one direction; the receiver first makes a request to the relay with just the relay ID, which stalls until the sender makes another request to the relay with the relay ID and a message. Then the receiver receives the message, and both requests terminate. To send multiple messages both sides must make multiple requests.</p>

<p>YPilot shares its signaling relay with <a href="https://github.com/wdebeaum/svg-whiteboard">SVG Whiteboard</a>. The default <dfn>relay <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1738">URL</a></dfn> is <code>https://ssl.uofr.net/~willdb/cgi-bin/relay.pl</code>, but other <a href="https://github.com/wdebeaum/svg-whiteboard/blob/master/relay.pl">relays</a> may be used instead as long as all players who wish to connect to each other agree.</p>

<p>The relay ID must consist of alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores, and must be at least one character. If the message contains any line feed (<code>\n</code>) or carriage return (<code>\r</code>) characters, they will be converted to spaces.</p>

<p>To receive a message from relay ID <var>foo</var>, <var>Alice</var> makes an HTTPS <code>POST</code> request to the relay URL with the parameter <code>k=<var>foo</var></code>. To send a message <var>bar</var> to <var>Alice</var>, <var>Bob</var> can then make an HTTPS <code>POST</code> request to the relay URL with the parameters <code>k=<var>foo</var>&amp;m=<var>bar</var></code>. The parameters must appear in that order, and <var>bar</var> must be URL-encoded. The relay will respond to <var>Alice</var>'s request with (decoded) <var>bar</var> as the content, and it will respond to <var>Bob</var>'s request with empty content.</p>

<p>A bidirectional signaling relay may be set up with two relay IDs, a <dfn>send ID</dfn> and a <dfn>receive ID</dfn>. Two players share both IDs, and <var>Alice's</var> send ID is <var>Bob</var>'s receive ID, and vice versa. The two relay IDs should be created randomly when the bidirectional signaling relay is set up (i.e. they are UUIDv4s, like player IDs, but specific to the connection).</p>

<h2>WebRTC</h2>
<p>Once a bidirectional signaling relay exists, it can be used to set up a <dfn>peer connection</dfn> using <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webrtc/">WebRTC</a>. This type of connection is potentially more direct, and will take the load off of the signaling relay. To set up a peer connection, players negotiate over the signaling relay (involving <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5245">ICE</a> candidates and offers) until a way to connect is agreed upon.</p>

<h2>Hub</h2>
<p>At any point during a game, exactly one player is designated the <dfn>hub</dfn>. All non-hub players maintain peer connections with the hub. All players (including the hub) simulate the game world in parallel. All input events must travel through the hub to be sequenced and rebroadcast before any players (including the hub) may incorporate them into the simulation.</p>

<p>Which player is the hub may change during the game, and must change if the hub leaves a game that still has other players. <em class="TODO">how to do this deterministically and fairly, even when the hub is forcibly disconnected?</em></p>

<h2>Messages</h2>
<p>All messages exchanged by YPilot players are <a href="https://json.org/">JSON</a> objects. Most have a common property named <code>op</code> (short for "operation") which is a string identifying the type of message.</p>

<h3>Initial messages</h3>
<p>An <dfn>initial message</dfn> is a message sent over a signaling relay before a player is connected to another player. Initial messages have a <code>sender</code> property containing another object, with properties for the sender's player ID (<code>id</code>), current handle (<code>handle</code>), and public key (<code>publicKey</code>). The first two are strings, the last is in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517">JSON Web Key (JWK)</a> format.</p>

<p>Initial messages are turned into <dfn>signed messages</dfn> before being sent over the signaling relay. First the message is encoded as a <a href="https://unicode.org/">UTF-8</a> string, then a <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648#section-4">base64</a> encoded signature is generated using the sender's private key. Then the message string and the signature string are put in a new JSON object, and that object is sent over the signaling relay.</p>

<p>So an initial message that starts out looking like this:</p>
<code><pre>
{
  "<var>key1</var>": <var>val1</var>,
  "<var>key2</var>": <var>val2</var>
}
</pre></code>

<p>first has a <code>sender</code> added like this:</p>
<code><pre>
{
  "sender": {
    "id": "<var>sender-id</var>",
    "handle": "<var>sender-handle</var>",
    "publicKey": <var>sender-public-key-JWK</var>
  },
  "<var>key1</var>": <var>val1</var>,
  "<var>key2</var>": <var>val2</var>
}
</pre></code>

<p>and ends up being sent as a signed message that looks like this:</p>
<code><pre>
{
  msg: "{\"sender\":{\"id\":\"<var>sender-id</var>\",\"handle\":\"<var>sender-handle</var>\",\"publicKey\":<var>sender-public-key-JWK</var>},\"<var>key1</var>\":<var>val1</var>,\"<var>key2</var>\":<var>val2</var>}",
  sig: "<var>msg-signature-base64</var>"
}
</pre></code>

<p>The receiver of such a signed message then unwraps it again, verifying the signature and trusting the public key on first use (TOFU). If the signature is invalid or the public key doesn't match one the receiver already has associated with this <var>sender-id</var>, the message is dropped.</p>

<p>Other details of initial messages depend on the value of the <code>op</code> property:</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>"askStatus"</code>
<dd>If <var>Alice</var> wants to know what game <var>Bob</var> is playing and with whom, she sends an <code>askStatus</code> initial message to <var>Bob</var>'s player ID via the signaling relay:
<code><pre>
{
  "op": "askStatus",
  "replyTo": "<var>recvID</var>"
}
</pre></code>
If <var>Bob</var> wishes to, he can then send a <code>status</code> initial message (described below) to <var>recvID</var> via the signaling relay. <var>Alice</var> should start listening for this reply before sending the <code>askStatus</code> message.
<dt><code>"status"</code>
<dd>If <var>Bob</var> wishes to reply to an <code>askStatus</code> message, he can send a <code>status</code> initial message to <var>recvID</var> via the signaling relay:
<code><pre>
{
  "op": "status",
  "configURL": "<var>configURL</var>"
  "players": {
    "<var>playerID1</var>": <var>playerDescription1</var>,
    "<var>playerID2</var>": <var>playerDescription2</var>
  }
}
</pre></code>
The <var>configURL</var> is the URL to load the <code><a href="README-yp.html">.yp</a></code> file describing the game from. <em class="TODO">describe player descriptions... like senders?</em>
<dt><code>"join"</code>
<dd>If <var>Alice</var> wants to join the game that <var>Bob</var> is playing (whether or not <var>Bob</var> is the hub), she can send a <code>join</code> initial message to <var>Bob</var>'s player ID via the signaling relay:
<code><pre>
{
  "op": "join",
  "replyTo": "<var>recvID</var>"
}
</pre></code>
If <var>Bob</var> wishes to let <var>Alice</var> join the game, and <var>Bob</var> is the hub, he can start setting up a peer connection with <var>Alice</var> by sending a <code>handshake</code> WebRTC setup message to <var>recvID</var> via the signaling relay. If <var>Bob</var> isn't the hub, he can instead send a <code>vouch</code> peer message to the hub.
<dt><code>"handshake"</code>
<dd>The <code>handshake</code> message moves the signaling relay into a mode where it can be used to facilitate setting up a peer connection with WebRTC. Continuing the above example, <var>Bob</var> already has a <var>recvID</var> for sending messages back to <var>Alice</var> via the signaling relay. By sending a <code>handshake</code> to <var>recvID</var>, he also creates a <var>sendID</var> for <var>Alice</var> to send messages back to <var>Bob</var>:
<code><pre>
{
  "op": "handshake",
  "replyTo": "<var>sendID</var>"
}
</pre></code>
Now the signaling relay is bidirectional, and specific to the new connection between <var>Alice</var> and <var>Bob</var>. From this point on it will be used for WebRTC setup messages instead of initial messages. To start, the joining player, <var>Alice</var>, uses her end of the peer connection to create a data channel.

<em class="TODO">direct text messages?</em>

<h3>WebRTC setup messages</h3>
<p>A <dfn>setup message</dfn> is a message sent over a bidirectional signaling relay connecting the hub player of a game to a new player trying to join the game. These messages are used by the WebRTC protocol to set up a peer connection between the two players, so that they can stop using the relay and communicate more directly.</p>

<p>Unlike initial messages, setup messages are not signed and do not include a <code>sender</code>. The connection is already private because it's over HTTPS and uses relay IDs (<var>sendID</var> and <var>recvID</var>) known only to the two connected players (and the relay itself), and the players are already authenticated to each other because they signed the <code>join</code> and <code>handshake</code> initial messages that set up the bidirectional signaling relay.</p>

<p>The <code>op</code> property identifies the type of message:</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>"offer"</code> / <code>"answer"</code>
<dd>These messages are used to exchange session descriptions (<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3264">SDP offer/answer</a>).
<code><pre>
{
  "op": "<var>op</var>",
  "description": <var>sessionDescription</var>
}
</pre></code>
When either message type is received, the receiver should set their remote description to <var>sessionDescription</var>. If it was an <code>offer</code>, the receiver should then create an answer, set their local description, and send that local description in an <code>answer</code> message.
<dt><code>"addCandidate"</code>
<dd>The <code>addCandidate</code> message requests the receiver to add an ICE candidate. A player sends it when their peer connection emits an <code>icecandidate</code> event with a non-<code>null</code> <code>candidate</code>.
<code><pre>
{
  "op": "addCandidate",
  "candidate": <var>iceCandidate</var>
}
</pre></code>
</dl>
