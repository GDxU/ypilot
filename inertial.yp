# keeps going when forced to move
an Inertial thing is Mobile and has
  a mass which is a number (default 16)
  a force which is a Vec2 object (default Vec2[0,0])

when the clock ticks and
  there is a thing ?t which is
    Inertial with mass ?m and force ?f
    Mobile with velocity ?v
then
  ?t becomes Mobile with velocity (?v + ?f * (1.0 / ?m))
